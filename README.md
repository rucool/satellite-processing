### coldest_pixel
Contains tools for producing netCDF files containing the daily coldest pixel composite using NOAA-AVHRR satellite SST declouded based on reflectivity in the visible spectrum. This method of declouding is limited to daylight hours, but lets in cold water that often gets flagged as clouds based on other declouding algorithms, making this product a useful tool for identifying upwelling regions and storm cooling earlier than they are typically seen in other SST products.
